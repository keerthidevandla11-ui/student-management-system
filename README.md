📖 What I Learned

Using Python lists & dictionaries to store structured data.

Creating functions to organize code.

JSON file handling for saving/loading data.

Input validation and preventing duplicate records.

Building a menu-based console application.

🔮 Future Improvements

Search by name (partial match)

Sort records by Roll No or Name

Export data to CSV

Use SQLite database instead of JSON

Add GUI with Tkinter

Web version using Flask
